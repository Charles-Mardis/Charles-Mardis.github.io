# Personal Portfolio
## Project Description and Motivation
This project is for my Personal Portfolio. The reason I'm making this is to show future employers who I am and what my skills are. The motivation of this project is to make myself stick out from others. 

## Prior Art
This project will present other projects. It will show websites i've made, python programs, and other side projects. 

## Core user Workflows
I would like for the project to look like this:
- a nav bar at the top
- a personal discription with a picture and my contacts
- my projects with a picture, user should be able to click on them to be taken to the project shown
- a contact section at the very bottom 

## Tuesday - Thursday daily goals
- Tuesday: foundation code, have all of my html together, no css/ bootstrap
- Wednesday: implement css/bootstrap/css-grid, get the website looking how I would like it.
- Thursday: implement media queries for laptops/desktops, tablets, and phones
